# LLM Parameters Visualization 🔍

Ever wondered what the parameters in large language models actually look like? This notebook lets you peek inside any Hugging Face model's safetensors file and visualize the learned weights.

### Features
Visualizations 📊

- Weight Distributions - Histograms showing how parameters are distributed
- 2D Tensor Heatmaps - Visual representation of weight matrices
- Box Plots - Compare parameter ranges across different tensors

Load any Hugging Face model with safetensors format 🤗
